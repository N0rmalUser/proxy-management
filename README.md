# proxy-management

When the proxy is turned off, the icon in the context menu looks like a cross, and when turned on, like a circle.  
You can change the icons to your own in C:\ProgramData\Proxymanager.  
proxy_autorun.exe it starts 1 time when the computer is turned on and changes the icon depending on whether the proxy is enabled
